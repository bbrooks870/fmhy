## wiki page

- "Update toc on scroll",
- "same h2 names =>SAME ID - eg: in edupiracy guides",
- "add base64, instead of scrape-store_to_db-fetch",
- try : instead of passing {...props} to the component, instead pass only required props : may have performance improvements.

## wiki page bugs from migration

- hover on h1 and h2 doesnt show "#"
- fix seo and give better head-title for each page

## general

- auth? for guide-queue, and links queue
