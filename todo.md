## wiki page

- "Update toc on scroll",
- "same h2 names =>SAME ID - eg: in edupiracy guides",
- "add base64, instead of scrape-store_to_db-fetch",

## wiki page bugs from migration

- fix seo and give better head-title for each page
- cant share search result
- fix layout on wiki page -> remove all calcs
- replace imgs with next/image
- for the search bar on navbar -> replace it with a normal div looking similar to it

## general

- auth? for guide-queue, and links queue

## points to remember

- guides, wiki is using getstaticprops: so remember to update the revalidate time as required
