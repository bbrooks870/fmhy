## wiki page

- "Update toc on scroll",
- "same h2 names =>SAME ID - eg: in edupiracy guides",
- redirect to diff page not working. eg:
  https://www.fmhy.ml/wiki/audiopiracyguide#audio_tools : solution do the same checks in h2renderer to h1. (or just use the same fn for both ) : similarly for h3 and h4

## wiki page bugs from migration

- fix seo and give better head-title for each page
- refreshing a search result page should fetch reftch results as well
- fix layout on wiki page -> remove all calcs

## general

- auth? for guide-queue, and links queue
