# Website for [FMHY](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/)

### Features:

- Detailed WIKI
- Search
- Guides page

Migrated frontend from [React version](https://github.com/zeus-12/fmhy-ui), and backend from [Express Version](https://github.com/zeus-12/fmhy-server)

### What needs to be fixed

- reset scroll to zero upon changing wiki category: seems to be an open nextjs issue => try using the workarounds.
- add search for wiki page => checkout nextra docs
- fix seo and give better head-title for each page => use next-seo package
- make guides fitered by query params -> and add it to spotlight
- toc seems to break at times
